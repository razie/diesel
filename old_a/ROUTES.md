## Embedding the controllers

Both the Diesel controllers and Wiki Controllers are Play Framework controllers,
easy to embed in your app if you embed their routes.

Their routes start with `/diesel` and `/wiki` respectively, so they should be easy to add to your own controllers.

TBD - the actual Routes
TBD - play version and inclusions

etc
