  * With the Mongo implementation, there are two tables: Audit for events to be reviewed and
  * AuditCleared for reviewed events. You need your own purging
  * of the AuditCleared table.
  *
  * The Play Controller for these is controllers.AdminAudit
  *
  * these are also used for cluster notifications

  * TODO should have a configurable workflow for each of these - what's the pattern?
